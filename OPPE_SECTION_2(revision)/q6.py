'''
Vowel count of words
Write a program that takes a string and counts the number of vowels in every word. The program should then print each word followed by the count of vowels in parentheses.

Assume words are seperated by space and spaces should be retained in the output.

NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

Input Format

A string in the first line.
Output Format

A string with vowel count of each word in parantheses after each word.
Example

Input

Computer science is amazing
Output

Computer(3) science(3) is(1) amazing(3)
'''

words = input().split(" ")
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = 0
for word in words:
    for char in word:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1
    print(f'{word}({count})')
            
    count = 0
