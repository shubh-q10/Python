'''

Given a sequence of n strings as input, create a final word by appending and prepending the strings alternately based on their order. 
Strings at even indices (0-based) are appended to the end, while strings at odd indices are prepended to the beginning.

NOTE: This is an I/O type question, you need to write the whole code for taking input and printing the output.

Input Format

The fist line consists of the number of strings n.
Next n lines consists of the strings to append and prepend.
Output Format

The output string.
Examples

Input 1

6
h
t
o
y
n
p
Output 1

python
Explanation

Append 'h' -> h
Prepend 't' -> th
Append 'o' -> tho

Input 2

6
1
2
3

Output 2

642135
Explanation:

Append '1' -> 1
Prepend '2' -> 21
Append '3' -> 213
Prepend '4' -> 4213
Append '5' -> 42135
Prepend '6' -> 642135
