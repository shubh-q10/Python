'''Ubbi Dubbi - Add "ub" and "dub" Alternately Before Vowels in the Text
Given a text file containing lowercase letters, modify the text such that:

Before each vowel, add the string "ub" if it is the first or an odd-numbered vowel encountered.
Add "dub" before the vowel if it is the second or an even-numbered vowel encountered.
Preserve the text's original formatting, including spaces and newlines.
Assume the input text is all lowercase and may have multiple lines.

NOTE: This is a file-in-stdout type question where the input is read from the file and the output is printed in the standard output.

Examples

Input

hello world
pyhton is good
Output

hubelldubo wuborld
pythdubon ubis gduboubod'''
