'''Given two integers a and b, return the sum of the two numbers where both numbers are floored to the nearest ten.

Flooring to the nearest ten means removing the unit digit and rounding the number down to the nearest multiple of 10.

Assume both the numbers are positive integers.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example
Input:

35, 46
Output:

70
Explanation:

35 floored to tens is 30.
46 floored to tens is 40.
Sum: 30 + 40 = 70.'''


def sum_of_floored_to_tens(a:int, b:int):
    return ((a//10)*10 + (b//10)*10)

print(sum_of_floored_to_tens(67, 89))
